# PixelColorApproximation

Rough approximation of pixel colors in Roblox.

Here is a direct comparison. The real pixel values (aka a screenshot of my actual screen) vs the approximated colors from this module.

It is clearly not exact, but it's remarkably close to the real screen! (If you squint hard enough)
